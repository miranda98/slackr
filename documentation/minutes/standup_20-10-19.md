###John:
- Not much done over past few weeks in relation to server work. Has been mostly been learning how the python stuff works. Going over lectures and the such to build a stronger understanding  
- Is feeling good and able to continue with work from this point onwards by himself  
- Will continue working on profiles, search and admin functions  
- Recommends setting a time scale on our milestones, as to prevent last minute time pressure  

###Miranda:
- Not much done over past few weeks in relation to server work. Has been mostly been learning how the python and tokens work.  
- Is feeling more confident, but will need some more time to review her functions.  
- Questions about auth implementation and tokenizing. Mitch recommends just using [JWT] since all the info can be stored in a simple token.  
- Will continue working on auth functions and stand up  
- Is feeling slightly overloaded with workload, if auth is too large to handle James has offered to help with Stand up functions  
- Questions about how much of functitons being implemented - simplified by Mitch, needed to know how early her functions need to be implemented and in what form [tie into milestones and time scale end date]  

###Mitch:
- Has been working on mapping all the files in the predevelopment branch, and hence no group members have to deal with Flask [horray!]  
- Because the code is run from server.py, import has to be in the format from . import [x]  
- Will mostly be working on all of channels. Will look into storing information staticly  
- Has helped understanding of other group members of their function implementation  

###James: 
- Has started work on message functions  
- Will continue working on message functions
- Has recommended use of Gitlab milestones - everyone happy to do so

Project will continue at a decent rate. Safty nets in case of any one struggling are now in place.
