A few clarifications were made about standups

Channels:
- Needs to add extra keys in the dictionary in "data['channels']"
    - Add keys for standup

Messages:
- Messages need to be added to list of messages with correct timestamp
- After standup, all messages need to be sent
- possibly edit messageSend function to check if a standup is active:
    - would append all the messages in a new dictionary/list while standup is active
    - after standup, append the messages to the message list


A question about emailing
- Need to create team email
- Assumption - password can be changed to a password that has been used before
- Question about the reset code
    - Used a hashed [user email+datetime] + truncation to generate 8 digit code
- Email template (helps with modularisation)
    - A basic template for all the reset mails
