- Had a lot going on, so hasn't been able to work on his stuff as much as he has wanted to.  
- Has finished 2 functions, just need to finish his remaining ones.  
- Minor struggles with git, mostly explained and errors solved now.  
- User profile, search and admin functions.  

##James  
- Has to implement helper functions in his code, mostly how his functions work with other functions.  
- Questions about some functions - but its mostly fine.  

##Miranda  
- After pushing stuff to pre-master, pretty much done.  
- Many functions can't be done till iteration 3, so workload is manageable
