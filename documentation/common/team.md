## Teamwork (Exercise 0) 

So far our teamwork has run smoothly leading up to the submission of iteration 1. Assurance in this pattern continuing is our communal discussions of expectations, deadlines and standards used throughout our project.
* Anticipating complication intersections between modules we agreed upon documenting to a communal folder under a directory structure resembling the package path. 
	* If any modules has specific 'quirks' or defined behaviours, it is recorded here to allow people using this module to use it breezily.
* Communication is paramount and so we have created a Facebook Messenger group chat from which each participate in asynchronous stand ups, sharing any progress on our own modules or shared files (e.g. assumptions.md, plan.md ...)
	* Also participate in more synchronous stand ups during labs.

TLDR
We aim to continue spiting the work as we have it now. We worked all of this out in the last iteration, gave certain people certain modules and are implementing them in an appropriate order.
